        "# Key Differences Between SQL and NoSQL Databases:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Structure:\n",
        "#    - SQL databases are structured and use tables with predefined schemas.\n",
        "#    - NoSQL databases are unstructured or semi-structured and use collections, key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Schema:\n",
        "#    - SQL databases have a fixed schema (strict structure).\n",
        "#    - NoSQL databases have a flexible schema (dynamic structure).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Scalability:\n",
        "#    - SQL databases scale vertically (adding more power to a single server).\n",
        "#    - NoSQL databases scale horizontally (adding more servers to distribute the load).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Data Storage Model:\n",
        "#    - SQL databases store data in relational tables.\n",
        "#    - NoSQL databases store data in various models like document-based (MongoDB), key-value stores (Redis), column-family stores (Cassandra), or graph-based (Neo4j).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Query Language:\n",
        "#    - SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying.\n",
        "#    - NoSQL databases use different query methods, like JSON-based queries in MongoDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. Transactions:\n",
        "#    - SQL databases support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.\n",
        "#    - NoSQL databases often follow the BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) model for flexibility.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "# 1. **Definition:**\n",
        "#    - A collection in MongoDB is similar to a table in SQL databases.\n",
        "#    - It is a group of documents (records) that share a common purpose but can have different structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. **Flexible Schema:**\n",
        "#    - Unlike tables in relational databases, collections in MongoDB do not require a fixed schema.\n",
        "#    - Each document within a collection can have different fields and data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. **Storage of Documents:**\n",
        "#    - Collections store data in BSON (Binary JSON) format.\n",
        "#    - Each document in a collection is uniquely identified by an `_id` field.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. **Example of a Collection in MongoDB:**\n",
        "#    - A collection named `students` may contain the following documents:\n",
        "#      ```\n",
        "#      { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 20, \"course\": \"Computer Science\" }\n",

        "#    - Notice that the second document has an additional field (`grade`), which is allowed due to the flexible schema.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. **Automatic Collection Creation:**\n",
        "#    - In MongoDB, a collection is automatically created when a document is inserted if it does not already exist.\n",
        "#    - Example:\n",
        "#      ```python\n",
        "#      db.students.insert_one({\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 20, \"course\": \"Computer Science\"})\n",
        "#      ```\n",
        "#      - If the `students` collection does not exist, MongoDB will create it.\n",

        "# 6. **Types of Collections:**\n",
        "#    - **Regular Collections:** Standard collections that store documents.\n",
        "#    - **Capped Collections:** Fixed-size collections that work as a circular buffer.\n",
        "#    - **Time-Series Collections:** Optimized for storing time-based data.\n",

        "\n",
        "# 1. **Replication in MongoDB:**\n",
        "#    - Replication in MongoDB is achieved using **Replica Sets**, which provide redundancy and high availability.\n",
        "#    - A replica set consists of multiple MongoDB instances (nodes) that maintain copies of the same data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. **Replica Set Components:**\n",
        "#    - **Primary Node:** Handles all read and write operations.\n",
        "#    - **Secondary Nodes:** Maintain copies of the primary node’s data and can take over if the primary fails.\n",
        "#    - **Arbiter (Optional):** Participates in elections but does not store data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. **How Replication Works:**\n",
        "#    - The primary node accepts write operations.\n",
        "#    - Secondary nodes replicate data from the primary asynchronously.\n",
        "#    - If the primary node fails, an automatic election occurs, and one of the secondary nodes is promoted to primary.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. **Automatic Failover:**\n",
        "#    - If the primary node goes down, MongoDB automatically elects a new primary from the secondaries.\n",
        "#    - This ensures continuous database availability without manual intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. **Read Scalability:**\n",
        "#    - Secondary nodes can serve read queries to distribute the load.\n",
        "#    - Applications can be configured to read from secondaries in read-heavy environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. **Example of a Replica Set Setup (Command in MongoDB Shell):**\n",

        "#      ]\n",
        "#    })\n",
        "#    ```\n",
        "#    - This command initializes a replica set with three nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. **Replication Benefits:**\n",
        "#    - Provides high availability by ensuring data is always accessible.\n",
        "#    - Enables data redundancy to prevent data loss.\n",
        "#    - Supports automatic recovery and failover.\n",
        "#    - Allows horizontal scaling of read operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. **Replica Set Election Process:**\n",
        "#    - When a primary node fails, the secondary nodes hold an election to choose a new primary.\n",
        "#    - The node with the highest priority and up-to-date data is elected.\n",
        "#    - Clients automatically reconnect to the new primary.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. **Write Concern and Data Consistency:**\n",
        "#    - MongoDB allows configuring write concern to ensure data is replicated before confirming a write.\n",
        "#    - Example:\n",
        "#      ```python\n",
        "#      db.collection.insert_one({\"name\": \"Alice\"}, write_concern={\"w\": 2})\n",
        "#      ```\n",
        "#      - This ensures the write is acknowledged by at least two replica set members.\n",

        "# 10. **Use Cases for MongoDB Replication:**\n",
        "#    - Disaster recovery to prevent data loss.\n",

        "# ---------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "# Transactions ensure data consistency and integrity when performing multiple\n",
        "# operations. Both MongoDB and SQL databases support transactions but differ\n",
        "# in their implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **1. Multi-Document vs Multi-Row Transactions**\n",
        "# -----------------------------------------------\n",
        "# - **MongoDB:** Transactions operate on multiple documents within a single\n",
        "#   or multiple collections.\n",
        "# - **SQL Databases:** Transactions operate on multiple rows in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **2. ACID Compliance**\n",
        "# ----------------------\n",
        "# - **MongoDB:** Starting from version 4.0, MongoDB supports ACID transactions,\n",
        "#   but they are not as deeply integrated as in SQL databases.\n",
        "# - **SQL Databases:** ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,\n",
        "#   Durability) are a fundamental part of SQL transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **3. Transaction Scope**\n",
        "# ------------------------\n",
        "# - **MongoDB:** Transactions are mainly used within a **replica set**.\n",
        "#   In version 4.2+, they also work across sharded clusters.\n",

        "# **5. Locking Mechanism**\n",
        "# ------------------------\n",
        "# - **MongoDB:** Uses **document-level locking**, meaning transactions\n",
        "#   affect only specific documents.\n",
        "# - **SQL Databases:** Uses **row-level, page-level, or table-level locking**,\n",
